Regexp:

Phone numbers (with area code): 
  re = /^\s+\(\d\d\d)/([\s0-9]+)
  \s -> whitespace 
  + -> one or more
  \d -> 0-9
  
  ( ) -> whatever is inside, we will remember that subset of the match for future use
  
  \d\d\d -> (#)(#)(#)
  
  
  
  class Account 
    attr_accessor :balance
    include Comparable
    def <=>(other)
      self.balance <=> other.balance
    end
    
    def initialize(balance)
      @balance = balance
    end
    
  end
  
  a = Account.new(50)
  b = Account.new(60)
  c = Account.new(100)
  
  c.between?(a, b)

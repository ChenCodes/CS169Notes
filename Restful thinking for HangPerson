Cookie: Maintaining state btw. a browser and a Saas Server. 
  Since the amount of information associated with a user's session is too much for storage in a cookie, we instead store a pointer to state that lives in a database in the cookie. 

Self Check Question: Enumerate the minimal game state that must be maintained during a game of Hangperson
    Minimal state: The secret word, the current letters guessed, and how many are left. 
    
Self Check question: Enumerate the player actions that could cause changes in the state.

  1. Guessing a letter: modifying the lists of correct/incorrect guesses, resulting in winning/losing the game.
  
  2. Starting a new game: choosing a new word and then we need to set the incorrect guess lists to empty. 
  
  
When setting up the entire web thing, we want to consider three things:

Route and Action        Resource Operation                         Web Result
'GET /show'             show game state                            display correct and wrong guesses so far
'POST/guess'            update game state with new guessed letter  redirect to show
'POST/create'           create new game            redirect to show 

POSTING IS IMPORTANT:
To start a new game, user needs to post a form that triggers the create actio.

'Get/new'    give human user a chance to start new game      display a form that includes a "start new game" button
